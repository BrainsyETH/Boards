# Website Naming Brainstorm

## Decision: Eddy

**Eddy** — A calm area of water formed behind an obstruction in a river. Short, memorable, and deeply rooted in river culture.

### Why Eddy Works

- **River-native**: An eddy is a fundamental river feature every floater knows
- **AI-ready**: The AI assistant *is* Eddy — "Ask Eddy about water levels," "Eddy says the Current River is running optimal today"
- **Brandable**: Works as a logo, domain, app name, and conversational persona
- **Short & memorable**: 4 letters, easy to spell, easy to say
- **Approachable**: Feels like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporate tool

### Tagline Candidates

- "Know before you float."
- "Your Ozarks float trip starts here."
- "River intelligence for Missouri floaters."
- "Plan smarter. Float better."
- "Every mile, every gauge, every trip."
- "Real conditions. Real rivers. Real plans."

### AI Assistant Voice

Eddy can serve as both the brand name and the AI assistant persona:
- "Eddy says conditions are optimal on the Meramec today."
- "Ask Eddy to plan your float."
- "Eddy checked the gauges — water is running a little low on Huzzah Creek."
